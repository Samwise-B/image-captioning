# Custom Transformer for Image Captioning

This project involves the development of a custom transformer-based image captioning model by integrating GPT-2 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures. The model was fine-tuned on the FLICKR30K dataset to generate meaningful captions for images, combining visual and textual modalities effectively.

## Key Features

### Model Architecture
- **Hybrid Transformer Design**: Spliced layers from GPT-2 with new cross-attention layers that interfaced with ViT's image encodings.
- **ViT as Image Encoder**: Used Vision Transformer (ViT) to process images and extract visual features.
- **GPT-2 for Language Generation**: Adapted GPT-2's decoder layers for generating captions based on visual features.

### Custom Engineering
- **Cross-Attention Mechanism**: Introduced custom cross-attention layers to bridge ViT's visual features with GPT-2's text generation capabilities.
- **Model Integration**: Seamlessly combined pre-trained components from ViT and GPT-2, preserving their individual strengths while enabling effective communication between modalities.

### Training and Fine-Tuning
- **Dataset**: Fine-tuned on the FLICKR30K dataset, ensuring the model learned high-quality caption generation.
